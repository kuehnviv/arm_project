# arm_project
ARM Projekt HS24 
## Topic: 

## Project evaluation (max. 16 points)
Minimum requirements (8 points):

The project must be a Data Analysis project, i.e., must include content of the quantitative part of the ARM module.

# The project must integrate several topics presented in the module, at a minimum these are the following: 

(1) Data collection using Web Scraping and/or a Web API.

(2) Data preparation (e.g. remove missing values and duplicates, create new variables, enrich the data with open data).

(3) Data storage in a database like SQLite, MySQL or PostgreSQL.

(4) Rich non-graphical and graphical exploratory data analysis (EDA).

(5) Use of multiple linear regression, regression tree or random forest regression as the modeling method.

(6) Model evaluation using suitable measures of fit (e.g. r-squared, rmse).

(7) Correct interpretation of model results and measures of fit.

(8) Making the material (data, Jupyter notebooks, ...) available on Moodle.

## Additional points, if the following criteria are met (max 5 points):

(1) Creativity of implementation (creative is anything not specified in the lessons and exercises).

(2) Use of a MySQL or PostgreSQL database (not SQLite!!!) for data storage and SQL-queries from within Python.

(3) Integration and visualization of geographical data.

(4) Use of a Chi-squared test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) or correlation analysis (each test must include a p-value).

(5) Use of more than one model for predictions (e.g. a multiple linear regression & a random forest)

## Project presentation in the form of a video-recording (max. 3 points).

To be evaluated:

(1) Structure & outline

(2) Topic presentation (topic clearly defined?, How convincingly presented?)

(3) Content (substance, depth, weighting of parts)

(4) Language / auxiliary tools (Freely spoken?)

(5) Quality of the presentation & slides

(6) Time keeping: length of presentation in minutes = number of students per group x 5 minutes.

### Notes: 

--> Use the slide set as the basis for the presentation.

--> Show the Python code & life demos only if it improves the understanding of methodes and results.

--> Do not just scroll through the code in the Jupyter notebooks without explaining the code and results.

## To be submitted on Moodle with the group number by each student:

1.) Video recording of the project presentation as mp4 file, e.g.: 'video_recording_group_01.mp4'.

    (Ensure that the video does not exceed the max. allowed file size on Moodle).

2.) Zip-File with all data and your Jupyter notebook(s), as, e.g.: 'materials_group_01.zip'

3.) Presentation as PDF file (as e.g. 'presentation_group_01.pdf') with the following minimal structure:

     - Title and full name of each student

     - Introduction (background, problem, objective, research question)

     - Materials and methods (data collection method, content of data, exploratory data analysis methods, modelling methods)

     - Results & Discussion

     - Conclusions

     - IMPORTANT!!! In the appendix of the presentation, include what you think you did to earn the points.

           - Use screenshots and code-snippets to clearly demonstrate this.

           - The final evaluation will be made by the lecturer, not exclusively based on your listing.
